# Detecting structural breaks within sequential music streams

This is the data and code for my ST451 final project: "Detecting structural breaks within sequential music streams."

*** PRIMARY EXAMPLE: ***
-

Note: within-notebook images may not load on preview because they are quite large.

To run:
1. Run any music notebooks you like individually.
  - The main notebook is:
    ```
    [saarland, Liszt_AnnesDePelerinage-LectureDante, pitch_mean] Detect structural breaks in sequential music data.ipynb
    ```
    Other notebooks (for other musical pieces) are stored in other_notebooks/. If you wish to run those, copy them out of that folder into the root folder ./ before running.
  - Naming convention: [corpus, composer, time series]
  - This generates results for those specific musical pieces.
    - Results will appear inline in the notebook.
    - Results will also appear in results/ subfolder with corresponding piece name.
2. Can compile paper tables with:
  - compile final results.ipynb
  - final dataset - summary stats.ipynb
